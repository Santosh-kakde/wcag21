# wcag21
[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) was published as a W3C Recommendation June 2018.

This repository was used to develop content for WCAG 2.1, as well as associated understanding documents and techniques. **It is no longer in use** and this repository is merely an archive.

Work on new versions of WCAG, as well as support material for all versions of WCAG, now takes place in the [wcag repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag).
