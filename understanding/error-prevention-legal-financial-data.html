            <h2>Intent of Success Criterion 3.3.4: Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious
         consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed.
         For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase
         stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences.
         If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with
         a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on
         the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more
         stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take
         place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise,
         it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored
         in a database that they later need to access, such as their entire travel profile
         in a travel services web site. When referring to modification or deletion of 'user
         controllable' data, the intent is to prevent mass loss of data such as deleting a
         file or record. It is not the intent to require a confirmation for each save command
         or the simple creation or editing of documents, records or other data.
      </p>
            <p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes. People with reading disabilities
         may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys
         by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake
         that could result in serious consequences. Providing the ability to review and correct
         information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action
         that has serious consequences.
      </p>
            <p>User-controllable data is user-viewable data that the user can change and/or delete
         through an intentional action. Examples of the user controlling such data would be
         updating the phone number and address for the user's account, or deleting a record
         of past invoices from a website. It does not refer such things as internet logs and
         search engine monitoring data that the user can't view or interact with directly.

                  </p>
            
                  <p>A Web retailer offers on-line shopping for customers. When an order is submitted,
               the order information—including items ordered, quantity of each ordered item, shipping
               address, and payment method—are displayed so that the user can inspect the order for
               correctness. The user can either confirm the order or make changes.

                  </p>
            
                  <p>A financial services Web site lets users buy and sell stock online. When a user submits
               an order to buy or sell stock, the system checks to see whether or not the market
               is open. If it is after hours, the user is alerted that the transaction will be an
               after-hours transaction, is told about the risks of trading outside of regular market
               hours, and given the opportunity to cancel or confirm the order.
