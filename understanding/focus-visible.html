            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help a person know which element has the
         keyboard focus.
      </p>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help a person know which element among
         multiple elements has the keyboard focus. If there is only one keyboard actionable
         control on the screen, the success criterion would be met because the visual design
         presents only one keyboard actionable item.
      </p>
            <p>Note that a keyboard focus indicator can take different forms. One common way is a
         caret within the text field to indicate that the text field has the keyboard focus.
         Another is a visual change to a button to indicate that that button has the keyboard
         focus.
