            <h2>Intent of Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help a person know which element has the
         keyboard focus.
      </p>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help a person know which element among
         multiple elements has the keyboard focus. If there is only one keyboard actionable
         control on the screen, the success criterion would be met because the visual design
         presents only one keyboard actionable item.
      </p>
            <p>Note that a keyboard focus indicator can take different forms. One common way is a
         caret within the text field to indicate that the text field has the keyboard focus.
         Another is a visual change to a button to indicate that that button has the keyboard
         focus.

            <h2>Benefits of Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible</h2>
            <ul>
            
               <li>This Success Criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page,
               by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will
               interact at any point in time.
            </li>
            
               <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
               executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.

            <h2>Examples of Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible</h2>
            <ul>
         
               <li>When text fields receive focus, a vertical bar is displayed in the field, indicating
            that the user can insert text, OR all of the text is highlighted, indicating that
            the user can type over the text.
         </li>
         
               <li>When a user interface control receives focus, a visible border is displayed around
            it.
         </li>
