            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to minimize the occurrence of content that
         requires timed interaction. This enables people with blindness, low vision, cognitive
         limitations, or motor impairments to interact with content. This differs from the
         Level A Success Criterion in that the only exception is for real-time events.

               <li>People with physical disabilities often need more time to react, to type and to complete
               activities.  People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen and
               to read.   People who are blind and using screen readers may need more time to understand
               screen layouts, to find information and to operate controls.  People who have cognitive
               or language limitations need more time to read and to understand.  People who are
               deaf and communicate in sign language may need more time to read information printed
               in text (which may be a second language for some).

               <li>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to
               a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.
