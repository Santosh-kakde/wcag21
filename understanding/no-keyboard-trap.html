         <p>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a <a>keyboard interface</a>, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface,

      methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.

            <h2>Intent of Success Criterion 2.1.2: No Keyboard Trap</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that that content does not "trap"
         keyboard focus within subsections of content on a Web page. This is a common problem
         when multiple formats are combined within a page and rendered using plug-ins or embedded
         applications.
      </p>
            <p>There may be times when the functionality of the Web page restricts the focus to a
         subsection of the content, as long as the user knows how to leave that state and "untrap"
         the focus.

            <ul>
         
               <li>

                     <strong>A calendar widget</strong>
               							     
                  </p>
            
                  <p>A calendar widget allows users to add, remove or update items in their calendar using
               the keyboard. The controls in the widget are part of the tab order within the Web
               page, allowing users to tab through the controls in the widget as well as to any links
               or controls that follow.

                  </p>
            
                  <p>Once a user tabs into an applet, further tabs and other keystrokes are handled by
               the applet. Instructions describing the keystroke used to exit the applet are provided
               prior to the applet as well as within the applet itself.

                  </p>
            
                  <p>A Web application brings up a dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons,
               Cancel and OK. When the dialog has been opened, focus is trapped within the dialog;
               tabbing from the last control in the dialog takes focus to the first control in the
               dialog. The dialog is dismissed by activating the Cancel button or the OK button.
