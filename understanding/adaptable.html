            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all information is available in a
         form that can be perceived by all users, for example, spoken aloud, or presented in
         a simpler visual layout. If all of the information is available in a form that can
         be determined by software, then it can be presented to users in different ways (visually,
         audibly, tactilely etc.). If information is embedded in a particular presentation
         in such a way that the structure and information cannot be programmatically determined
         by the assistive technology, then it cannot be rendered in other formats as needed
         by the user. 
      </p>
            <p>The Success Criteria under this guideline all seek to ensure that different types
         of information that are often encoded in presentation are also available so that they
         can be presented in other modalities.
