            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make it possible for users to locate content
         in a manner that best meets their needs. Users may find one technique easier or more
         comprehensible to use than another.
      </p>
            <p>Even small sites should provide users some means of orientation. For a three or four
         page site, with all pages linked from the home page, it may be sufficient simply to
         provide links from and to the home page where the links on the home page can also
         serve as a site map.

            <ul>
         
               <li>Providing an opportunity to navigate sites in more than one manner can help people
            find information faster. Users with visual impairments may find it easier to navigate
            to the correct part of the site by using a search, rather than scrolling through a
            large navigation bar using a screen magnifier or screen reader. A person with cognitive
            disabilities may prefer a table of contents or site map that provides an overview
            of the site rather than reading and traversing through several Web pages. Some users
            may prefer to explore the site in a sequential manner, moving from Web page to Web
            page in order to best understand the concepts and layout.
         </li>
         
               <li>Individuals with cognitive limitations may find it easier to use search features than
            to use a hierarchical navigation scheme that be difficult to understand.

                  <p>A large food processing company provides a site containing recipes created using its
               products. The site provides a search mechanism to search for recipes using a particular
               ingredient. In addition, it provides a list box that lists several categories of foods.
               A user may type "soup" in to the search engine or may select "soup" from the list
               box to go to a page with a list of recipes made from the company's soup products

                  <p>A local hair salon has created a Web site to promote its services. The site contains
               only five Web pages. There are links on each Web page to sequentially move forward
               or backward through the Web pages. In addition, each Web page contains a list of links
               to reach each of the other Web pages.

                  <p>An on-line banking site allows fund transfer between accounts via the Web. There is
               no other way to locate the confirmation of fund transfer until the account owner completes
               the transfer.
