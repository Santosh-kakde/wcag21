      <blockquote class="scquote">
         <p>Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is <a>essential</a>.</p>
         <p class="note">Examples where a particular display orientation may be essential are a bank check, a piano application, slides for a projector or television, or virtual reality content where binary display orientation is not applicable.</p>

            <h2>Intent of Success Criterion 2.6.2: Orientation</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all content and functionality is available regardless of the display orientation (portrait or landscape).  Some websites and applications automatically set the screen to a particular display orientation and expect
			that users will respond by rotating their device to match. However, some users have their devices mounted
			in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair). Therefore, websites and applications need to support both orientations
			by making sure content and functionality is available in each orientation. While the order of content and method of functionality
			may have differences the content and functionality is available. When a particular orientation is essential, the user
			needs to be advised of the orientation requirements.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Success Criterion 2.6.2: Orientation</h2>
            <ul>
					          <li>Users with dexterity impairments, who have a mounted device will be able to use the content in their fixed orientation.</li>

            <h2>Examples of Success Criterion 2.6.2: Orientation</h2>
            <ul>
				           <li>
                  <strong>Example 1: Online video site</strong>
                  <br/>
				Videos are not locked to a specific orientation.  A user can start a video with their device in a portrait orientation resulting in a smaller video being displayed and then rotate the device to landscape and have the video expand to fill the entire screen.  All controls and functionality are still available in the landscape orientation.</li>
				           <li>
                  <strong>Example 2: Messaging website</strong>
                  <br/>
				A messaging website can display messages in both portrait and landscape orientations without a loss of content or functionality. </li>
				           <li>
                  <strong>Example 3: eReader web app</strong>
                  <br/>
				An eReader web app can display the contents of a book in both portrait and landscape mode without a loss of content or functionality</li>
				           <li>
                  <strong>Example 4: Check deposit in banking app</strong>
                  <br/>
				An example where orientation is essential could be a banking app that requires the device be in landscape mode to easily and accurately capture an image of a check for deposit.</li>
				           <li>
                  <strong>Example 5: Piano app</strong>
                  <br/>
				An example where orientation is essential could be a piano app that requires the device to be in landscape mode to allow enough room for all of the piano keys to be accessible and usable.</li>
