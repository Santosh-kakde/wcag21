         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#audio-control"
               style="font-weight: bold;">1.4.2 Audio Control</a> (Level A): If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism" target="terms">mechanism</a> is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio
      volume independently from the overall system volume level.
   </p>
         <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used
      to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech output
         if there is other audio playing at the same time. This difficulty is exacerbated when
         the screen reader's speech output is software based (as most are today) and is controlled
         via the same volume control as the sound. Therefore, it is important that the user
         be able to turn off the background sound. Note: Having control of the volume includes
         being able to reduce its volume to zero.
      </p>
            <div class="note">
         
               <p>Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect a screen reader user's
            ability to find the mechanism to stop it because they navigate by listening and automatically
            started sounds might interfere with that navigation. Therefore, we discourage the
            practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last more than 3 seconds),
            and encourage that the sound be 
            <em>started</em> by an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather than requiring
            that the sound be 
            <em>stopped</em> by an action of the user after they land on the page.

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
         
               <li>Individuals who use screen reading technologies can hear the screen reader without
            other sounds playing. This is especially important for those who are hard of hearing
            and for those whose screen readers use the system volume (so they cannot turn sound
            down and screen reader up).
         </li>
         
               <li>This Success Criterion also benefits people who have difficulty focusing on visual
            content (including text) when audio is playing.
