            <h2>Intent of Success Criterion 3.2.1: On Focus</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that functionality is predictable
         as visitors navigate their way through a document. Any component that is able to trigger
         an event when it receives focus must not change the context.          Examples of
         changing context when a component receives focus include, but are not limited to:
         
      </p>
            <ul>
         
               <li>forms submitted automatically when a component receives focus;</li>
         
               <li>new windows launched when a component receives focus;</li>
         
               <li>focus is changed to another component when that component receives focus;</li>
         
            </ul>
            <p>Focus may be moved to a control either via the keyboard (e.g. tabbing to a control) or the mouse (e.g. clicking on a text field). Moving the mouse over a control does not move the focus
         unless scripting implements this behavior. Note that for some types of controls, clicking
         on a control may also activate the control (e.g. button), which may, in turn, initiate a change in context.

            <div class="note">
         
               <p>What is meant by "component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element"
            or "user interface component''.

            <h2>Benefits of Success Criterion 3.2.1: On Focus</h2>
            <ul>
            
               <li>This Success Criterion helps people with visual disabilities, cognitive limitations,
               and motor impairments by reducing the chance that a change of context will occur unexpectedly.

               <li>
            
                  <p>
               								       
                     <strong>Example 1:  A dropdown menu</strong>
               							     
                  </p>
            
                  <p>A dropdown menu on a page allows users to choose between jump destinations. If the
               person uses the keyboard to move down to a choice and activates it (with a spacebar
               or enter key) it will jump to a new page.  However, if the person moves down to a
               choice and either hits the escape or the tab key to move out of the pulldown menu
               â€“ it does not jump to a new screen as the focus shifts out of the dropdown menu. 
            </p>

                     <strong>
                  Example of a Failure:  A help dialog
                  
               </strong>
               							     
                  </p>
            
                  <p>
               When a field receives focus, a help dialog window describing the field and providing
               options opens. As a keyboard user tabs through the Web page, the dialog opens, moving
               the keyboard focus away from the control every time the user attempts to tab past
               the field.
