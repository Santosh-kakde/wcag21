            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to help ensure that people with disabilities who rely on visual labels can also use
			those labels programmatically. Controls are often labeled with visible text. Controls also have a programmatic label, known
			as its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">Accessible Name</a>. Users have a much better experience if the visible text labels of controls match their accessible
			names.</p>
            <p>Speech input users can navigate by speaking the visible text labels of menus, links and buttons that appear on the
			screen. It’s confusing to speech input users when they say a visible text label they see, but the speech input does not work
			because the accessible name that is enabled as a speech input command does not match the visible label.</p>
            <p>In addition, when the accessible name is different from the visible label, it essentially becomes an unknown hidden command
			for speech input users that can be accidentally activated without the user knowing what has happened.</p>
            <p>Text-to-speech users will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches the text they see on the screen.</p>
            <p>This issue is even more important for speech input and text-to-speech users who also have cognitive challenges. It’s an extra
			cognitive load for a speech input user to remember and say a speech command that is different from the visible label they see on a
			control. It’s also an extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb and understand speech output that does not
			match the visible label.</p>

                  <li>Accessible name does not contain the visible label text</li>

                  <li>Accessible name contains the visible label text, but one or more other words is interspersed in the label</li>
                  <li>Accessible name contains the visible label text, but one or more other words comes before the visible label text</li>
