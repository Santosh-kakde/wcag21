            <h2>Intent of Guideline 2.6: Additional sensor inputs</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Guideline is to ensure that web content does not interfere with sensor input while providing a fallback to other means of input where appropriate.</p>
            <p>Where sensor input such as deliberate motion of the device, or the user gesturing towards the device, is supported by authors as a means of actuation, web content should provide alternative means of actuation, such as interface controls that accept input via a keyboard interface and pointer input.</p>
            <p>Where sensor input is used to accommodate web content to the chosen device orientation, authors should not restrict or prevent such accommodation, or provide explicit choice to the user. Authors should not force users to use content only in a specific device orientation (portrait or landscape mode), unless the orientation is essential for the information conveyed.</p>
            <p>The focus of this guideline is on sensor information related to handling the device itself (e.g., when turning, inclining or shaking it) or motioning while being exposed to its sensors (such as performing gestures that are interpreted by the camera, proximity sensors, or depth sensors). Other device sensors exist that are not suitable or not intended to be used as a means of user actuation, such as temperature, pressure, or ambient light sensors. For these sensors, alternative means of input are not meaningful and not required.</p>
